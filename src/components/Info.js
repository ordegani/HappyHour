            1. Hair of the dog. Drinking to ease the symptoms of a hangover is
            sometimes called taking the hair of the dog, or hair of the dog that
            bit you. The notion is that hangovers are a form of alcohol
            withdrawal, so a drink or two will ease the withdrawal. There may be
            something to it, says Dr. Swift. Both alcohol and certain sedatives,
            such as benzodiazepines like diazepam (Valium), interact with GABA
            receptors on brain cells, he explains. And it's well documented that
            some people have withdrawal symptoms from short-acting sedatives as
            they wear off. Perhaps the brain reacts similarly as blood alcohol
            levels begin to drop. Even so, Dr. Swift advises against using
            alcohol as a hangover remedy. "The hair of the dog just perpetuates
            a cycle," he says. "It doesn't allow you to recover."

            2. Drink fluids. Alcohol promotes urination because it inhibits the
            release of vasopressin, a hormone that decreases the volume of urine
            made by the kidneys. If your hangover includes diarrhea, sweating,
            or vomiting, you may be even more dehydrated. Although nausea can
            make it difficult to get anything down, even just a few sips of
            water might help your hangover.

          <li>
            3. Get some carbohydrates into your system. Drinking may lower blood
            sugar levels, so theoretically some of the fatigue and headaches of
            a hangover may be from a brain working without enough of its main
            fuel. Moreover, many people forget to eat when they drink, further
            lowering their blood sugar. Toast and juice is a way to gently nudge
            levels back to normal.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Avoid darker-colored alcoholic beverages. Experiments have shown
            that clear liquors, such as vodka and gin, tend to cause hangovers
            less frequently than dark ones, such as whiskey, red wine, and
            tequila. The main form of alcohol in alcoholic beverages is ethanol,
            but the darker liquors contain chemically related compounds
            (congeners), including methanol. According to Dr. Swift's review
            paper, the same enzymes process ethanol and methanol, but methanol
            metabolites are especially toxic, so they may cause a worse
            hangover.

            5. Take a pain reliever, but not Tylenol. Aspirin, ibuprofen
            (Motrin, other brands), and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
            drugs (NSAIDs) may help with the headache and the overall achy
            feelings. NSAIDs, though, may irritate a stomach already irritated
            by alcohol. Don't take acetaminophen (Tylenol). If alcohol is
            lingering in your system, it may accentuate acetaminophen's toxic
            effects on the liver.
          </li>
          <li>
            6. Drink coffee or tea. Caffeine may not have any special
            anti-hangover powers, but as a stimulant, it could help with the
            grogginess. Coffee is a diuretic, though, so it may exacerbate
            dehydration.

            7. B vitamins and zinc. A study recently published in The Journal of
            Clinical Medicine evaluated the diets for 24 hours before and after
            excessive drinking occurred. It was a small study and results were
            based on the participants saying what they ate. However, they did
            find that people whose food and beverage consumption contained
            greater amounts of zinc and B vitamins had less severe hangovers.

            1. Eat breakfast: A protein and healthy fat breakfast can keep you
            full for longer and help prevent snacking during the day.
          </li>

          <li>
            2. Eat regular meals: This can help you burn calories more
            effectively and helps prevent mindless snacking.
          </li>

          <li>
            3. Remember your “five-a-day:” Fruits and vegetables can be a tasty
            snack and they can bulk out your meals. They are high in nutrients
            and fiber and low in calories and fat.
          </li>

          <li>
            4. Eat slow-burning calories: High-fiber carbohydrates, such as
            legumes, and healthy fats, such as avocado, take longer to release
            energy, so you will not get hungry as quickly.
          </li>

          <li>
            5. Exercise: This can help burn off extra calories, and it can make
            you feel good. A brisk daily walk is easy for most people to do and
            costs nothing. Challenge yourself with a pedometer. For people who
            use a wheelchair, there are exercises that can boost heart health
            and strength.
          </li>

          <li>
            6. Drink water: It is healthful, has no calories, and can fill you
            up. Avoid alcohol and sodas as these can easily provide far too many
            calories. If you crave sweet drinks, choose unsweetened fruit
            juices, or better still, get a juice maker.
          </li>

          <li>
            7. Eat more fiber: Fiber, found in fruits, vegetables, and
            wholegrains, can help you feel full and encourage healthy digestion.
